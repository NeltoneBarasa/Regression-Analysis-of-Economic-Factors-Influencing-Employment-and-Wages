# Regression-Analysis-of-Economic-Factors-Influencing-Employment-and-Wages

This Python script is designed to perform a regression analysis on economic data, focusing on the relationship between various industry types, ownership structures, employment, and wages. The first step is loading the dataset from a CSV file and inspecting its structure to ensure it’s ready for analysis. The script handles categorical variables (such as ownership type and industry code) by converting them into dummy variables. It also scales numeric variables like total wages and the number of establishments to ensure the data is normalized before regression. Missing values are addressed by dropping rows with any missing data.

The core of the analysis is an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, which examines the impact of independent variables like total wages, establishments, and year on the dependent variable, average monthly employment. The model’s results are displayed using the summary function from the `statsmodels` library, providing key statistics such as R-squared, p-values, and coefficients. The script also includes checks for multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation. Multicollinearity is tested using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), while heteroskedasticity is assessed using the Breusch-Pagan test. The Durbin-Watson statistic is used to check for autocorrelation in the residuals.

Finally, the script includes several visualizations to help interpret the regression results. A residual plot is generated to visualize the fit of the model and identify any potential patterns in the residuals. Additionally, a heatmap is created to visualize the correlations between the independent variables, ensuring that no strong correlations are present that might skew the results. The final regression results are saved into a CSV file for further analysis. This code provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing economic data through regression, making it useful for understanding the factors influencing employment and wages across different industries and ownership structures.
